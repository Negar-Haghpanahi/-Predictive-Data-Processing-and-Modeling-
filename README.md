# -Predictive-Data-Processing-and-Modeling

Project Description:
In this project, three robust data modeling algorithms, namely Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Boosting, were employed for rent predictions, demonstrating expertise in machine learning. The system is designed with user-friendly features, including the ability to save results in formats such as Excel or CSV and store them in databases like SQL Server and MongoDB.
